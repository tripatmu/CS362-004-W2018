The following bugs have been detected in the case of edelenj (ONID):1.	Adventurer2.	Smithy3.	VillageBug 1: AdventurerThe test for the number of coins failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing AdventurerInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: Okay!Number of Actions Checked: Okay!Number of Coins Checked: FAILED!Expected: Coin++, Actual: 3Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 1The test is failed because the excepted number of coins must be at least +1 for the Adventurer card from the previous game state to account for addition of at least one (1) treasure card. This is observed from the Dominion code of edelenj in the function adventurerEffect as below:if (cardDrawn == estate || cardDrawn == duchy || cardDrawn == province)	  drawntreasure++;	else{	  temphand[z]=cardDrawn;	  state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).	  z++;	}The if condition for the cardDrawn must be changed as follows to represent the treasure cards:1.	“cardDrawn == estate” to “cardDrawn == cooper”2.	“cardDrawn == duchy” to “cardDrawn == silver”3.	“cardDrawn == province” to “cardDrawn == gold”Bug 2: SmithyThe test for the number of hand count failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing SmithyInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: FAILED!Expected: 7, Actual: 6Number of Actions Checked: Okay!Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 1The test for Smithy failed because the card allows three (3) additional cards to be drawn and so, the test is expecting a total of seven (7) cards beginning from five (5) accounting for a discard card. Expected cards are 5 + 3 – 1 = 7, but actual cards are only six (6).  This is observed from the Dominion code of edelenj in the function smithyEffect as below:   for (i = 0; i < 2; i++)	{	  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);	}The for loop must be incremented by +1 to have the meet the specification of the Smithy card to allow for three (3) additional cards in hand instead of just two (2). Thereby:		Change the for-loop counter - From “i < 2” To “i < 3”.Bug 3: VillageThe test for the number of actions failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing VillageInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: Okay!Number of Actions Checked: FAILED!Expected: 3, Actual: 1Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 1From a state of one (1) available action, the Village card should give three (3) additional actions to total of three (3) actions (1 + 2 = 3). Here, the actual action remained to by just one (1) without any addition or subtraction of the actions from the beginning game state.This is observed from the Dominion code of edelenj in the function villageEffect as below:      
      //+2 Actions      state->numActions = state->numActions--;The number of actions must be incremented to plus two (2) instead of having a decrement of one (1). The possible cause of actual number of actions being exactly one (1) could be from drawing a card from deck which provide one additional action. Therefore, 1 (beginning game state) + 1 (draw card) – 1 (decrement number of actions in Village function) = 2 number of actions.Therefore: 		Change - 	From “state->numActions = numActions--” 				To “state->numActions = numActions+2”.
