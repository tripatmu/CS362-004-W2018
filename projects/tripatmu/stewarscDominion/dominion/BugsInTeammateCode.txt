The following bugs have been detected in the case of stewarsc (ONID):1.	Adventurer2.	Smithy3.	Village4.	OutpostBug 1: AdventurerThe tests for the number of hand count and number of coins failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing AdventurerInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: FAILED!Expected: 6, Actual: -66Number of Actions Checked: Okay!Number of Coins Checked: FAILED!Expected: Coin++, Actual: 0Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 2The test failed because the number of hand count expected is six (6), but instead the actual hand count is a negative number, -66. In addition, the number of coins have been decreased to zero (0) instead, it must be increment to at least one addition coin to account for drawn treasure card.This is observed from the Dominion code of stewarsc in the function callAdventurer as below:  while(drawntreasure<=2){  if (state->deckCount[currentPlayer] <1){//if the deck is empty we need to shuffle discard and add to deck    shuffle(currentPlayer, state);  }  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);  cardDrawn = state->hand[currentPlayer][state->handCount[currentPlayer]-1];//top card of hand is most recently drawn card.  if (cardDrawn != copper && cardDrawn == silver && cardDrawn != gold)    drawntreasure++;  else{    temphand[z]=cardDrawn;    state->handCount[currentPlayer]--; //this should just remove the top card (the most recently drawn one).    z++;  }Here, the error can be observed in the While-loop of the function and also, in the second IF-condition. The following changes can be made to correct the bugs in the function:1.	Change – From “drawntreasure<=2” To “drawntreasure < 2”2.	Change – 	a.	From “cardDrawn != copper && cardDrawn == silver && cardDrawn != gold”	b.	To “cardDrawn != copper && cardDrawn == silver && cardDrawn != gold”Bug 2: SmithyThe test for the number of coins was failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing SmithyInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: FAILED!Expected: 7, Actual: 6Number of Actions Checked: Okay!Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 1The number of hand count for Smithy failed because it is expecting a total of seven (7) cards in hand as 5 (beginning game state) + 3 (draw three additional cards) – 1 (discard one card) = 7 total cards in hand.This is observed from the Dominion code of stewarsc in the function callSmithy as below:  	for (i = 1; i < 3; i++) 	 {  		  drawCard(currentPlayer, state);  	 }      The error can be fixed by changing following:	From “for(i = 1; i < 3; i++)” To “for (i = 0; i < 3; i++)”Bug 3: VillageThe test for the number of coins was failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing VillageInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: Okay!Number of Actions Checked: FAILED!Expected: 3, Actual: 5Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Total Errors: 1The number of available actions for Village failed to meet specification requirement of the card. An addition of two (2) actions is excpected from the beigning game state havine one (1) actions. Thus, the expected number of actions is three (3), but the actual number of actions is five (5). Therefore, the number of available is incremented by plus two (2).This is observed from the Dominion code of stewarsc in the function callVillage as below:  	//+2 Actions  	state->numActions = state->numActions + 4;The changes to fix the bug can be made as follows:	-	From “state->numActions = state->numActions + 4” 	-	To “state->numActions = state->numActions + 2”Bug 4: OutpostThe test for the number of coins was failed for the adventure card as shown in the except of the unittestsresult.out below:Testing OutpostInitialize GameInitialization Successful!Hand Count Checked: Okay!Number of Actions Checked: Okay!Played Card Count Checked: Okay!Outpost Played Card Count Checked: FAILED!Expected: 1, Actual: -1Total Errors: 1The test checks for the outpost played count to be incremented by one (1) whenever an Outpost card is played and therefore, the expected number of outpost played count is one (1) with a beginning game state of zero (0). The actual number of outpost played count is a negative number (-1) and so, the test is failed.This is observed from the Dominion code of stewarsc in the function callOutpost as below:  	//set outpost flag  	state->outpostPlayed--;The number for the outpost played count can be adjusted to increment plus one as follows: 	From “state->outpostPlayed--” To “state->outpostPlayed++”
